LTP build log
===============


While the ``configure`` log indicates a successful configuration process, there are a few _weak points_ or potential areas of concern that could be improved or might cause issues later in the build process. These are not critical failures, but they are worth noting for future reference or troubleshooting:


----


1. Missing Headers	
--------------------

   - ``dmapi.h``: Not found. This header is related to Data Management API (DMAPI), which is used for hierarchical storage management (HSM) in some filesystems (e.g., XFS). If the software relies on DMAPI functionality, this could cause issues.
     - **Action**: If DMAPI functionality is required, ensure the `dmapi` development package is installed (e.g., `libdmapi-dev` or similar).
   - **mm.h**: Not found. This header is related to memory management. Its absence might limit certain low-level memory operations.
     - **Action**: Investigate if this header is required for specific features. If so, ensure the appropriate kernel headers are installed.
   - ``linux/module.h``: Not found. This header is related to kernel module development. Its absence suggests that kernel module-related functionality might not be available.
     - **Action**: If kernel module support is needed, ensure the kernel headers are installed (e.g., `linux-headers` package).
   - ``sys/jfsdmapi.h``: Not found. This header is related to JFS (Journaled File System) DMAPI. If JFS-specific functionality is required, this could be a problem.
     - **Action**: Ensure the JFS development package is installed if needed.


----


2. Missing Structs
--------------------

   - ``**code:``**``: Not found. This struct is used for low-level process tracing and debugging (e.g., with `ptrace`). Its absence might limit certain debugging or tracing features.
     - **Action**: Ensure the correct kernel headers are installed. This struct is typically defined in `<sys/user.h>` or `<sys/reg.h>`.
   - ``struct ptrace_peeksiginfo_args``: Not found. This struct is used for advanced signal handling with `ptrace`. Its absence might limit signal-related debugging features.
     - **Action**: Investigate if this struct is required for specific functionality. If so, ensure the kernel headers are up to date.
   - ``struct signalfd_siginfo.signo``: Not found. The script found `ssi_signo` instead, which is a similar field. This might cause issues if the software expects the `signo` field specifically.
     - **Action**: Verify the software's compatibility with the available `signalfd_siginfo` struct.


----


3. XFS Quota Support
----------------------

   - ``xfs/xqm.h``: Not found. This header is related to XFS quota management. If the software relies on XFS quota functionality, this could cause issues.
     - **Action**: Ensure the XFS development package is installed (e.g., ``xfsprogs-devel`` or similar).


----


4. Weak or Missing Kernel Features
------------------------------------

   - ``clone()`` with 7 arguments: Supported. However, if the system or kernel is updated, this might change. The `clone()` system call is used for creating lightweight processes (threads), and its behavior can vary across kernel versions.
     - **Action**: Ensure the kernel is up to date and supports the required `clone()` functionality.
   - ``MREMAP_FIXED``: Found. This is a kernel feature for memory remapping. While it is present, its availability depends on the kernel version.
     - **Action**: Verify that the kernel version supports this feature if it is critical for the software.


----


5. Potential Library Issues
-----------------------------

   - ``libaio``: While ``libaio.h`` and ``io_setup`` are found, the script checks for ``io_set_eventfd``, which is defined. However, if the library version is outdated, this could cause issues.
   - **Action**: Ensure the `libaio` library is up to date.
   - ``libnuma``: While ``numa_alloc_onnode``, ``numa_move_pages``, and ``numa_available`` are found, NUMA functionality depends on the system's hardware and kernel support.
   - **Action**: Verify that the system has NUMA-enabled hardware and that the kernel supports NUMA operations.


----


6. SELinux and Capabilities
-----------------------------

   - **SELinux**: The script confirms that ``is_selinux_enabled`` is available in ``libselinux``. However, if SELinux is not properly configured on the system, this could cause runtime issues.
     - **Action**: Ensure SELinux is properly configured and enabled if the software relies on it.
   - **Capabilities**: The script checks for ``PR_CAPBSET_DROP`` and ``PR_CAPBSET_READ``, which are found. However, if the system's capability model is restrictive, this could limit functionality.
     - **Action**: Verify that the system's capability model aligns with the software's requirements.

7. Weak Points in Subdirectory Configuration (``utils/ffsb-6.0-rc2``)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

   - ``sys/limits.h``: Not found. This header is related to system limits. Its absence might limit certain system resource checks.
     - **Action**: Ensure the correct system headers are installed.
   - ``lrand48_r`` and ``srand48_r``: Found, but these functions are not thread-safe on all systems. If the software relies on thread-safe random number generation, this could cause issues.
     - **Action**: Consider using alternative thread-safe random number generators if needed.


----


8. General Recommendations
----------------------------

   - **Kernel Headers**: Several missing headers (``dmapi.h``, ``mm.h``, ``linux/module.h``) suggest that the kernel headers might not be fully installed. Ensure the correct kernel headers are installed for your system.
   - **Library Versions**: While the required libraries are found, their versions might not be optimal. Ensure all libraries (e.g., ``libaio``, ``libnuma``, ``libselinux``) are up to date.
   - **System Configuration**: Some features (e.g., NUMA, SELinux, XFS quotas) depend on system configuration. Verify that the system is properly configured for these features.


----


Summary of Actions:
--------------------

1. **Install Missing Headers**: Ensure ``dmapi.h``, `mm.h`, ``linux/module.h``, and ``xfs/xqm.h`` are available if needed.
2. **Verify Kernel Support**: Ensure the kernel supports required features like ``clone()``, ``MREMAP_FIXED``, and ``ptrace``-related structs.
3. **Update Libraries**: Ensure ``libaio``, ``libnuma``, and ``libselinux`` are up to date.
4. **Check System Configuration**: Verify that SELinux, NUMA, and XFS quotas are properly configured if required.

By addressing these weak points, you can ensure a smoother build process and avoid potential runtime issues.

## Project: pci-watcher
- **Toolchain**:
  - OpenAI 0.8.0
  - pandas 1.1.5
- **Project Details**:
  - Developing a Linux PCI-related driver called `pci-watcher`.
  - The driver monitors PCI devices, interacts with specific PCI devices,
  	and logs PCI-related events.
  - Development is being done in a virtual machine.
  - Plan to use autotools for the build system.
- **Preferences**:
  - Prefer automation scripts for `git push` that exclude verbs like `add`
  	and `commit`.
